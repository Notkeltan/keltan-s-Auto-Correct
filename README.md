# Auto Correct

A minimalist Obsidian plugin that automatically corrects misspelled words as you type.

## Features

- **Auto-correct on Space** — Type a misspelled word, press Space, and it's instantly corrected
- **Case-insensitive** — "OMG" and "omg" both correct to the same result
- **Simple format** — Define corrections as `misspelled : correct`, one per line
- **Works everywhere** — Source mode and Live Preview mode

## How to Use

1. Go to **Settings → Auto Correct**
2. Add your corrections in the format:
   ```
   teh : the
   OMG : Oh My Gods
   vinyette : vignette
   ```
3. Type in any note — corrections happen automatically when you press Space
